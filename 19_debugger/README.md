# Debugging

The same concepts apply to every debugger. 

* Breakpoints - add a line of code where execution will pause
* Stepping - execute code on demand, line by line
* Watch - observe the state of variables
* Callstack - go through the functions stack
* Execute code on demand - write expressions without rerunning
