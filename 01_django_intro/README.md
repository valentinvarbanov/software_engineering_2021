# Introduction to Django

## Model View Controller

Resources about the MVC architecture:

- https://www.educative.io/blog/mvc-tutorial
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC

Note: There may be differences on how the communication from the **Model** to the **View** is shown. In the real world different frameworks use slightly modified architectures to better match their needs.

## First Django tutorial

To create the first app follow the official [Django Getting Started Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/).


## Other resources

- A [good explanation](https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them) on what the **PATH** variable is.
