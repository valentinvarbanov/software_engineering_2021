The template for writing a story is:

```
As [user], I want to [what?], so that [why?].
```

## User Story example

```
As an admin, I want to be able to enter students' weekly schedule, because the schedule can't be modified by unauthorized users.

Acceptance criteria:
* There is a UI that allows the admin to enter schedule
* Non-admin users do not allow the schedule to be edited
* A popup is shown to unauthorized users
```
